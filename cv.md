## Code skill
Attention!!!
Kata 7 codewars
Details:
Trolls are attacking your comment section!
A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".
Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

Solve:
```javascript
function disemvowel(str) {
return str.replace(/[aeiouAEIOU]/gi, '');
}
```
